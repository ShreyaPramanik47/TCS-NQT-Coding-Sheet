# TCS NQT Coding Problems

This repository contains solutions to various coding problems frequently asked in **TCS NQT** exams. It is organized into different categories based on the type of problem.

## Categories

- **[Array](./Array)**: Problems related to array manipulation, sorting, searching, and optimization techniques.
- **[String](./String)**: Covers string operations, pattern matching, and string manipulation problems.
- **[Sorting](./Sorting)**: Includes sorting algorithms and challenges based on sorting techniques.
- **[Number System](./NumberSystem)**: Problems related to number theory, conversions, and mathematical computations.
-  **[Numbers](./Numbers)**: Problems related to number & mathematical computations.

## How to Use

Each category has a collection of C++ files with well-documented solutions. Feel free to explore the code, use the examples, and practice to improve your problem-solving skills.
